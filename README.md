  # 8) 2D Array Operations: Write a C program to find the sum of all elements in a 2D array.

    Input: Array = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}

    Output: Sum = 45

  # 9) 2D Array Operations: Write a C program to find the transpose of a 2D array.

    Input: Array = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}

    Output: Transpose = {{1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9}}

  # 10) 2D Array Operations: Write a C program to multiply two matrices and store the result in another matrix.

    Input: Matrix1 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} Matrix2 = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}}

    Output: Result = {{19, 22}, {43, 50}}
